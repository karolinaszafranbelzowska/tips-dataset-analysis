The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open. Taken from: [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)

## Libraries used
Imported the libaries for this project: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

Matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.

     import numpy as np
     import pandas as pd
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 


## What each file contains:
